# GBAGame

Project Description
Objective
This project aims to provide hands-on experience in developing C programs for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) platform. Working in a team of two to four, our goal is to create a complex and engaging game that showcases our ability to implement advanced programming concepts in a real-world application.

Game Overview
Our game, chosen for its creativity and the challenge it presents, is designed to fully utilize the capabilities of the GBA. We aim to push the boundaries of what can be achieved on this platform, ensuring an immersive and enjoyable experience for players.

Key Features
Scrolling, Tiled Background: The game features a continuously scrolling background, creating a dynamic and engaging environment for players to navigate through.
Multiple Sprites: At least two distinct sprites are utilized in the game, adding variety and depth to the gameplay through the introduction of various characters or objects.
Assembly-Optimized Functions: To enhance the game's performance and demonstrate advanced programming skills, we have incorporated two functions written in assembly code. Each function comprises at least eight lines of code and plays a crucial role in the game's functionality.
Game Style: The style and theme of the game were carefully selected to provide a unique experience. Whether it's a homage to classic games or an entirely original concept, our game is designed to be engaging and memorable.
Development Teams
This project is a collaborative effort, brought to life by the dedication and creativity of our team members. Each team member has contributed significantly, from initial concept development to the final implementation, ensuring that every aspect of the game is polished and optimized for the best possible player experience.

Goal: Collect 10 points before the Purple Man makes a collision with you (the collision only takes into account when you jump at the same time as when you make a collision)

How to Play
Navigate through the city by running and jumping onn blocks.
Collect coins placed on top of buildings to earn points.
Avoid colliding with the Purple Man while jumping to survive.
Reach 10 points to achieve victory.

Features
Scrolling, Tiled Background: Experience a vibrant valleyscape as you surf through the blocks.
Two Different Sprites: Control your character and the Purple Man with distinct sprites.
Two Assembly Functions: The game incorporates two essential functions written in assembly code, each comprising at least eight lines of code.
Coin Collection: Each coin collected contributes 4 points to your score.
Game Over Screen: Encounter a dynamic Game Over screen when the Purple Man collides with you.
Each coin is 4 points
